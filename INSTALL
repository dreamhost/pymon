Please see the DEPENDANCIES file as well as the README.

To install the application with all the defaults, simply run the usual:

  python setup.py install

This will install the required python libraries, "binaries", configuration
files, and a daemontools setup. The python libraries will be installed in the
usual place, and all the PyMonitor files you might need to change and/or
configure, will be installed in /usr/local/pymon.

Note: if you wish to install PyMonitor in a directory other than
'/usr/local/pymon', you will have to make the following changes:

    1) Edit the INSTALL_DIR constant in setup.py 
    2) Edit the INSTALL_DIR constant in ./lib/app/pymon/constants.py
    3) Edit the INSTALL_DIR constant in ./service/run

Also, if you have twisted installed in a non-standard directory, you will need
to make the appropriate changes to ./service/run.
