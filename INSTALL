Please see the README.

pymon runs under a dedicated user and group. If you don't have a user
and group on your system for pymon, you need to add them now.

*** IMPORTANT ***
You must create a copy of etc/example-pymon.conf and name it 
"etc/pymon.conf". The install script setup.py will not run 
without it.

Edit your pymon.conf file to your tastes and needs, particularly changing
the "user" and "group" directives to match the user and group under
which your pymon install will be running.

To install the application with all the defaults, simply run the
usual:

  python setup.py install

This will install the required python libraries, "binaries",
configuration files, and a daemontools setup. The python libraries
will be installed in the usual place, and all the pymon files you
might need to change and/or configure, will be installed in
/usr/local/pymon.

See the README for instructions on running pymon.
