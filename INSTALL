Please see the README.

*** IMPORTANT ***
You must create a copy of etc/example-pymon.conf and name it 
"etc/pymon.conf". The install script setup.py will not run 
without it.

Edit your pymon.conf file to your tastes and needs.

To install the application with all the defaults, simply run the
usual:

  python setup.py install

This will install the required python libraries, "binaries",
configuration files, and a daemontools setup. The python libraries
will be installed in the usual place, and all the pymon files you
might need to change and/or configure, will be installed in
/usr/local/pymon.
