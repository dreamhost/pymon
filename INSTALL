Please see the DEPENDANCIES file as well as the README.

To install the application with all the defaults, simply run the
usual:

  python setup.py install

This will install the required python libraries, "binaries",
configuration files, and a daemontools setup. The python libraries
will be installed in the usual place, and all the pymon files you
might need to change and/or configure, will be installed in
/usr/local/pymon.

Note: if you wish to install pymon in a directory other than
'/usr/local/pymon', you will have to make changes to the following
file:

    ./lib/app/pymon/constants.py

You will most likely want to edit the run inteval, the number of
seconds between service polls. After you install pymon, edit
/usr/local/pymon/bin/pymon.tac and change the value of INTERVAL to
something that suites your needs.

IMPORTANT !!! You will need to change the following file:

    /usr/local/pymon/conf/pymon.ini

This is where you define all your hosts and the thresholds for OK,
WARN, and ERROR triggers. In addition, your ping and sendmail
binaries need to be specified here. The ping binary is set in the
ping defaults section. The sendmail binary is set in the system
mail section.

To run pymon, you just need to do the following:

  twistd -noy /usr/local/pymon/bin/pymon.tac
