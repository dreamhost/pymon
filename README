config.ini conventions
======================
* sections are composed of three parts:
 1) source host (the host from which the monitoring is done)
 2) destination host (the host which is being monitored)
 3) the service type being monitored (ping, process, wed page check, etc.)

* ok, warn, and error thresholds must:
 1) be defined for each service type
 2) have comma separated values
 3) the values must be inclusive and not overlap with each other 


======================
creating a new monitor
======================
If you want to add more monitoring types, you will need to:

    * add the type to conf/pymon.ini
    * edit the lib/app/pymon/config.py class file if you want to be able to
    access your new configuration via an attribute of config.pymon
    * add a new PyMonX protocol subclass to lib/app/pymon/protocols.py to handle
    data processing and saving.
    * add a getXMonitors() funtion to lib/app/pymon/monitors.py
    * add a call to your new getXMonitor() funtion in bin/pymon.tac
    runMonitors()
    * rebuild pymon with 'python setup.py install'


======================
api notes
======================
The currently defined monitor types are as follows:
    * ping
    * HTTP
    * SNMP
    * SMTP
    * local process
    * local directory
    * local file
    * remote process
    * remote directory
    * remote file
    
If the option name 'service type' ever changes, the lib/app/pymon/config.py
class will have to be updated.
