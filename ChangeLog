of integer return codes, failing all the threshold tests.
* Made further refinedments on states and statesdetail templates as well as
CSS modifications.
* Added missing VERSION file.

2005.12.17

* I Couldn't get the includes to work right for the ZConfig files, so I put
all the schema files togheter in one schema.
* To circumvent bootstrapping issues during install, the datatypes used in
pymon's ZConfiguration are going to be called from adytum libraries, a
dependency that will need to be installed prior to running pymon's setup.py.
* The adytum libraries that have been a part of the working dreictory will now
be separated out.

2005.12.16

* Wrote a utility function pyInstall() in presetup.py that downloads and
installs pymon dependencies.
* Changed DEPENDENCIES to a useful file to be used during installation for
downloading missing software. It's now a python data structure that gets
eval'ed in presetup.py.
* Renamed the "conf" dir to "etc".
* Updated the INSTALL instructions.

2005.12.15

* Created pre- and postsetup.py files for getting around the setuptools
sandbox.

2005.11.14

* Updated the conf/example-pymon.conf and conf/schema.xml with the code
developed in the tests.
* Reorganized the service configuration nesting.
* Made use of the "extends" attribute in the schema and most of the schema 
redundancies.
* Split schemas (ZConfig definitions) up into separate files for ease of
development and maintenance; each monitor will have its own schema file, and
the monitors will be grouped together in another services schema file.
* Added ZConfig loaders and configuration instance to pymon config.
* Setup bin/pymon to import cfg from pymon.config.

2005.11.13

* Added date range custom datatype.
* Added configuration and tests for scheduled outages per service.
* Filled out the rangedValues() datatype/validator in pymon.zconfig so that it
can parse things such as "10-21", "10, 12, 14", and "10, 24, 30, 44-49".
* Added configuration scheme for HTTP status checks.
* Added example configuration for HTTP status checks as well as doctests for
the configuration.

2005.11.12

* In the great debacle of lib rearrangement, the zconfig.py file was deleted
with no existing copy remaining anyway. I attempted to reconstruct it from
scratch.
* Added support for default email notification list withing the general
configuration section and overrides in ping-defaults as well as ping.
* Added another set of tests for configuration (for pings).

2005.11.07

* Started working on an executable pymon file, such that the entire pymon
application could be run from a python egg.
* Added more schemas to conf/test for integration into the ZConfig for pymon.

2005.11.06

* Nope. It didn't work. Had to merge lib/app/pymon from previous revision.
* Tried moving pymon out of app.
* That *did* work. pymon is now a top-level package with it's own namespace.
* Re-did all the edits to the python files to reflect the namespace changes.

2005.11.05

* Changed setup.py so that it wouldn't violate the security/sandbox issues of
EasyInstall (commented out the chmod/chown).
* Began converting to SConfig configuration by adding a schema.xml and
example-pymon.conf to the conf dir.
* Created a conf/tests directory for this process and for developer reference.
* Created a conf/old directory for previous configuration files.
* Added custom validators to pymon for zconfig (these are in
adytum.app.pymon.zconfig).

* Added an elif clause to clients.rules.ThresholdRules to set the local status.
* Created a new class in clients.base called NullClient that subclasses from
twisted.internet.protocol.Protocol and ClientMixin.
* Modified the HTTP Monitor class by adding clientConnectionRefused that sets
self.protocol to NullClient() and performs required calls.

2005.06.20

* Moved state defaults out of their tempary home in pymon.clients.ping and
into where they belong: pymon.application.State.__init__().
* Added utils.isInList() function for checking thresholds that aren't ranges
but lists of expected values.
* Created pymon.clients.base.ThresholdRules which is instantiated by
ClientMixin and used by each Client class during connectionLost (when data is
returned).
* Moved get*Threshold() methods out of ClientMixin and put them in
ThresholdRules.
* Removed status checking from clients.ping.
* Added more state info to clients.ping.
* Removed email send from clients.ping and put it into ThresholdRules.

loads when you go to localhost:8080 after starting pymon).
* Added a missing spacer to the image dir.
* Began the process of removing the constants file (added vars to setup.py and
created conf/tempate-pymon.xml).
* Sandbox: added test code for HTTP status.
* Updated monitors to support HTTP status checks.
* Updated clients.http to support HTTP status checks (still need to do
threshold checks and email alerts).
* Added line to build.sh to remove /usr/local/pymon.

2005.06.14

* Added script for updating all svn repos in lib.
* Made the build.sh script more x-platform by getting the python prefix path
(I was just being selfish and using the Mac OS X path).

2005.06.13

* Manually added ui.web.pages that the merge didn't do for some reason.
* Site update: added a news item about the merge and hinted at upcoming alpha
release.

* Did more work on getting http status checks running.
* Added placeholders for dns, mysql, ftp and smtp clients.

2005.06.08

* Moved the servers out of the .tac file and put them in a newly added
pymon.servers class file.
* Moved class-level properties in ping.ClientMixin to properties set during
__init__.
* Added a connectionMade() method to ping.PingClient that calls super classes'
connectionMade()/__init__() methods.
* Bug fix: fixed bad class syntax in http.*.
* Bug fix: monitors.MonitorMixin wasn't being called in some classes and was
being called wrong in another one (missing part of the signature).
* Removed some old bin dir files.
* Removed unsed lib files.
* Due to an oversight, the ui.web.pages file never got added to subversion.
Added it.
* Added build and test scripts to ensure that oversights like that mentioned
above don't happen again.

2005.06.07

* Moved monitor (twisted factory) creation out of the main tac file and into
an "engines" file, since the way the factories are created will affect the
application as a whole, and for different tunings, different ways of creating
the factories will be used.
* Started to stub out the code for HTTP status checks and HTTP text checks.

2005.06.05

* Started making changes to the config file for DNS dig checks.

2005.06.04

* Created an agents.py file for the perspective broker process server.
* Added an agents section to the example-pymon.xml system section.
* Added a local agent ProcessServer to the pymon.tac file for executing local
binaries.
* Got the new pymon.tac running with the refactored ping monitor/factory and
client code (subclasses of pb.PBClientFactory and pb.Broker).
* Changes to the example-pymon.xml config file.

2005.05.30

* Sandbox: added a test for local or remote process execution via
twisted.spread.pb (perspective broker).
* Sandbox: cleaned up code in previous/other *.tac files.

* Sandbox: more fixes for some of the test code.
* Sandbox: added state machine demo for pb client factory.

2005.05.29

* Sandbox: added a test for running a process and returning output through 
a local TCP client/server setup.

2005.05.28

* Started making changes to all the code that needs access to the unique id 
of a service.
* Added group and user id elements to the system section of the XML config
file.
* Changed the .tac file so that uses these ids to set the uid/gid of the
twistd process.

2005.05.27

* Bug fix: example-pymon.xml had a bug: "enabled" was at the same level as
"services", and since thee names were different, it was treating everything
at that level like a dictionary instead of a list. I therefore had to take
the "enabled" tag and subtags out of "services" and put them in their own
level.
* Changed the .tac file to reflect the above-mentioned change in
XML/configuration.
* Generalized service component nomenclature in configuration XML file
(renamed "hosts" to "entires" and "host" to "entry").
* Changed example-pymon.xml to reflect the use of URIs for the new unique
identification scheme for services.
* Added missing test.py test harness to branch.

2005.05.23

* Added global registry test code to the sandbox.
* Added missing support for top-level module names in the test harness
test.py.
* Added pymon.registry and doctests to code base.
* In pymon.application, added a State class (dict subclass) and a History
class that is a subclass of both Queue and object. There is dual inheritance
because you cannot create and/or set arbitrary attributes on Queue objects.
* Added global varibale names to the configuration file to ease code
maintenance where calls are made to the globalRegistry.
* Added a backup service for writing state data to disk.
* Added configuration for backups to config/pymon.xml.

* Added functionality to application.State.__init__() that checks for the
state data backup/restore file on disk and if it exists, loads the state data
and deletes the file.
* Wrote doctests for application.State, included testing backup() and 
restore().
* Moved monitors back into the main lib, out of the plugins dir.
* Created monitors.AbstractFactory.
* Created monitors.PingMonitor.
* Added support for loading sample configuration into the test harness so that
modules that require configuration information can be tested.
* Removed the runMonitor() from pymon.tac.
* Updated doctests in application.State.

2005.05.22

used by Nevow for html templates, styles, etc.
* Added static subdirectories to pymon.ui.web.Root for accessing images,
icons, styles, etc.
* Copied contrib/Zope/ZPT files to static web for use in Nevow. These are
still ZPT and haven't been converted yet. This will have to wait until the
refactor branch is merged, since it will require the new state machine.
* Created appropriate Nevow page classes for main web ui page and sub pages.
* Created a basic site.css file.

of the protocol code.
* Site update: Updated the news on the pymon.sf.net website.
* Updated the css and home.html of the pMI with the look and feel of the
pymon.sf.net site. REALLY needs to be cleaned up. And prepared for Nevow.

a copy with no Factory code in it).
* Made changes to pymon.tac based on the reactor tests.
* Updated the setup.py to install adytum.utilities.
* Bug: this has been mentioned on the mail list, but I thought it should go in
here too: there is currently a bug in the HTTPClient code somewhere. The first
call to a remote webserver successfully connects, but all others seem to fail
due to timeout. This really needs to be addressed.
* Bug: when pymon.tac is run with HTTPClient enabled, shutdown (^C) takes
FOREVER. It often has to be manually killed.

2005.05.08

* Added a PyMonState instantiation in pymon.workflow as that which should be
imported from the module.
* Added a placeholder for the license.

to indicate one no longer needs to edit the service/run script.

2005.04.12

* Added storage and schema placeholders for the data API.
* Added an api.py file for consistancy of interface for developers and users
of pymon.
* Removed some old files that are no longer useful.
* Added directories for future interfaces and adaptors. These things have come
up in mail list discussions, and will most likely be used. Preferably sooner
than later.
* Moved updateDatabase() from pymon.datamanager to where it should be, in
a data store specific file: pymon.storage.sqlobject.

elegance.
* Enforced int() on the port number in pymon.monitors.getHTTPMonitors().

2005.03.27

* Changed reactor.connectTCP method.
* Added setHTTPConfigs method to __init__.
* Changed PyMonHTTPClientFactory to use protocol.ClientFactory.

2005.03.10

* Updated site news.
* Updated site menu links.

2005.03.09

* Updated the setup.py script to install the adytum.net.http package.

2005.03.08

* Rearranged the configuration ini files and python classes.
* Wrote a HTTP configuration and monitor.
* Started writing a protocol to handle HTTP status data for HTTP monitor.

2004.10.14

* Uploaded new site look and feel, logo, and menus to sf.net.
* Updated the project details on sf.net.

2004.10.13

* Allan Bailey gave his project space on sourceforge.net.
* Archived original site into svn for the sake of history.
* Created new logo for sf.net site.

2004.10.11

* Updated pymon.tac with comments.
* Moved the old app.pymon.monitor file.
* Created a new app.pymon.monitor for the twisted version of pymon.
* Renamed app.pymon.monitor to app.pymon.monitors.
* Removed all the stuff from pymon.tac that was added to app.pymon.monitors.
* Setup app.pymon.protocols.PyMonPing() to set a data dict containing current
service status info.
* Added more entries to the default ping configurations in config.ini.
* Put data inserting and updating capabilities in
app.pymon.protocols.PyMonPing for now, but I will take this out as soon as
it's been generalized. Data inserts and updates are working like a charm, and
previous/current states are being accurately reported.
* Separating the data insert/update code was actually very easy, so I went
ahead and did it (app.pymon.datamanager). However, I still need to add last*
timestamps.
* Added logic for "Recovering" state, tested and seems to be working
properly... better, in fact, than the PyMonitor that's in production right
now.
* Added comments to .ini file.
* Began adding support for local process checks.
* Updated README with more notes about adding monitors.

2004.10.10

* Cleaned up the .tac file code a little, as well as the protocols.
* Added a data dir.
* Added database setup configuration to .ini
* Reworked adytum.app.pymon.datamodel, including the addition of doctests.
Doctests were crazy... I wanted to use a test db if the doctest was running
the code, and use the real database otherwise. Checking for __name__ didn't
work, since doctest re-imports the module, so I had to do some checks against
the stack. I don't know much about that stuff, so the check is very fragile.

2004.10.09

* Removed empty dirs.
* Added conf, contrib dirs.
* Added place-holder for twisted deamon in bin dir.
* Added protocols and data model from sandbox.
* Added Zope-specific files in contrib dir.
* Added setup.py file.
* Created a daemontools service direcctory, and removed log dir, since we will
be using stdout, letting daemontools perform the logging.
* Added INSTALL and DEPENDANCIES files.
* Updated README.
* Began creating a configuration methodology.
* Added a constants file in adytum.app.pymon.
* Added doctests for first ping methods in config.
* Completely rewrote adytum.net.ping by deleting everything that was in there
and writing a Parser class for ping output.
* Added tons mode doc tests that helped my fing bugs in the ping.Parser class.
* Updated protocols and tac file with fixes and improvements.

2004.10.08

* Have begun reorganization of packages, modules, and library files for use in
the next version of PyMonitor.
* Moved monitoring-specific code into lib/app/pymon directory and renamed
files to conform with the adytum conventions.
* Moved general PyMonitor files into the adytum.os and adytum.net packages.
* Re-organized top-level files.
* Updated site content -- news and main page.

2004.05.13

* fixed the issue with last check/ok/warn/err dates only reporting the last
check time
* removed the deepcopy and used copy instead (was getting recursion errors)

2004.05.12

* created pickle-specific methods and renamed methods that are used for
dealing with pickle files
* edited the svn commit shell script to clear out pyc files and remove the
tmp files 
* the _getLastRun method made a call to loadRunData which called
_loadPickleFile, but then didn't return anything. Fixing this fixed all the
issues I was having with save state info.

2004.05.11

* added support for giving friendly(er) names to data files
* pulled out references to remote_* in Internet/Site.py
* successfully tested site monitoring with Internet/Site 
* added a 'close' connection to the httpconn so that I could pickle the data
(can't pickle a network connection)

2004.05.09

* moved subject template for email notifications out of System/Monitoring.py
and into Monitor.py so that each service can customize it
* The problem with remote process monitoring notifications was due to the
fact that two rounds were being done at the same time: OK -> ERROR (round 1) +
ERROR -> ERROR (round two) = no change between final state of round 1 and 2
and thus no message got sent.
* Fixed a bug in process_monitor script: two calls to processMonitor for
remote host services monitoring
* Set the external storage back to binary pickles
* Created a bunch of methods for accessing summary data and creating files
that contain summary data.
* Correcteed the messages that were getting saved to summary data
* Changed the sort order for the summary data
* Moved System/Hosts to Internet/Ping
* Added Internet/Site and began stubbing out code for site monitoring.

2004.05.02

* moved email message templates into *Monitor methods so they could be
easily tailored to each service being monitored
* added message for ping monitoring
* moved *Monitor methods out of Monitoring class and into Monitor class
* moved Monitoring class into System package

2004.04.28

* added minimal support for ping-monitoring hosts
* separated more code into general monitoring and type of monitoring 
* added a 'debug' property to Monitor.py and System/Host.py and removed
print statements that were cluttering output
* fixed database naming for ping monitoring
* fixed a bug (type) in database naming for service monitorings without a
remote host set
* removed the binary parameter from the read/write methods and created a new
property 'binary_pickle' that is checked before reading or writing pickles
files
