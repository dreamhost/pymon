  o created pickle-specific methods and renamed methods that are used for
dealing with pickle files
  o moved pickle methods into Utils/PickleTools.py
  o added an exception for items that don't exists in old data (last_state =
old_data.last_state[service])

2004.05.11
  o added support for giving friendly(er) names to data files
  o pulled out references to remote_* in Internet/Site.py
  o successfully tested site monitoring with Internet/Site 
  o added a 'close' connection to the httpconn so that I could pickle the data
(can't pickle a network connection)

2004.05.09
  o moved subject template for email notifications out of System/Monitoring.py
and into Monitor.py so that each service can customize it
  o The problem with remote process monitoring notifications was due to the
fact that two rounds were being done at the same time: OK -> ERROR (round 1) +
ERROR -> ERROR (round two) = no change between final state of round 1 and 2
and thus no message got sent.
  o Fixed a bug in process_monitor script: two calls to processMonitor for
remote host services monitoring
  o Set the external storage back to binary pickles
  o Created a bunch of methods for accessing summary data and creating files
that contain summary data.
  o Correcteed the messages that were getting saved to summary data
  o Changed the sort order for the summary data
  o Moved System/Hosts to Internet/Ping
  o Added Internet/Site and began stubbing out code for site monitoring.

2004.05.02
  o moved email message templates into *Monitor methods so they could be
easily tailored to each service being monitored
  o added message for ping monitoring
  o moved *Monitor methods out of Monitoring class and into Monitor class
  o moved Monitoring class into System package

2004.04.28
  o added minimal support for ping-monitoring hosts
  o separated more code into general monitoring and type of monitoring 
  o added a 'debug' property to Monitor.py and System/Host.py and removed
print statements that were cluttering output
  o fixed database naming for ping monitoring
  o fixed a bug (type) in database naming for service monitorings without a
remote host set
  o removed the binary parameter from the read/write methods and created a new
property 'binary_pickle' that is checked before reading or writing pickles
files
