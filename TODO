o Migrate from pickled data to ZODB

o examine methodologies for performing the most checks in the shortest time;
calculate limitations of system (number of hosts, time to check hosts, max
checks in a given interval, etc.)

o The databases seem to continuously grow, when they should only have data for
at most, two runs; this needs to be examined

o enable multiple criteria for process matching

o enable use of "Friendly Names" in emails

o clean up tmp data files older than 10 minutes/monitoring interval

o clean up multiple inheritance

o clean up all the class attributes laying around

o the changes to fix the timestamps for previous states may have introduced a bug: recovering states may not be being set properly now. emails are being sent out properly, but the web status page doesn't seem to display them properly. This would be related to the data property in _getPickledStatesSummary.
