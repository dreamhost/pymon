o Migrate from pickled data to ZODB

o examine methodologies for performing the most checks in the shortest time;
calculate limitations of system (number of hosts, time to check hosts, max
checks in a given interval, etc.)

o The databases seem to continuously grow, when they should only have data for
at most, two runs; this needs to be examined

o enable multiple criteria for process matching

o enable use of "Friendly Names" in emails

o clean up tmp data files older than 10 minutes/monitoring interval

o clean up multiple inheritance

o Persistant storage doesn't seem to be working well... last WARN/ERR times don't seem true

o If the data files are new, there is no "old" data from previous runs, and therefore, calls such as the following generate errors:
  last_state = old_data.last_state[service] (in System/Monitoring.py)

o clean up all the class attributes laying around
